    "Additional Ideas  \n",
    "Continuing from the above analysis of most common house numbers, it presents the question of does the pattern of house rank being similiar to house number continue throughout the dataset, or does a seperation begin at later values? We could explore the dataset further to answer this question by producing a scatterplot of house number versus rank and visualize if any seperation in the linear trend appears. Defining the exact point of seperation (if one exists) could prove challenging, as we have seen that the house rank to number do not exactly line up 1 to 1 (ie. Rank 4 is house number 5, not 4). We would have to define a \"seperation\" criteria (ie. rank - house number > 10) or do some statistical analysis to test if a change in the pattern has infact occured.   "

    "Although there is missing data in the Barcelona OSM dataset, it is the data inconsistencies that seem most prevelent and can prove to be the most difficult to deal with. Simply checking if the data exists does not suffice for data inconsistencies, and ensuring that the data is in the expected form (ie. a single or list of house numbers) needs to be done before proper analysis can be performed, as was exemplified in the above report."
