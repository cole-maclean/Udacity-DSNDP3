    "<b>Additional Ideas</b>  \n",
    "There is a large number of datapoints with missing house number data within the Barcelona dataset. In order correct for this missing data, it may be possible to use the assumption that house numbering follows a fairly linear pattern as you traverse each way, so using a linear interporated imputation for missing values may be a valid methodology. To implement this, we would need to iterate over the nodes found on each way (from the ways node_refs list) and collect each nodes \"addr:housenumber\" attribute. If the \"addr:housenumber\" attribute does not exist, we would lookup the 2 closest neighbors that do have \"addr:housenumber\" data using the lat/lon coordinates and then linearly interpotale the nearest whole number between those \"addr:housenumber\" data to be used as the nodes \"addr:housenumber\" data. This could prove to be a challenging methodology to implement, and does not gaurentee accuracy. It would be important to setup visualizations of the above approach to ensure it works as expected."

    "<b>Conclusions</b>   \n",
    "The missing and inconsistent data in the Barcelona OSM dataset seems to be prevelent and can prove to be the difficult to deal with. Simply checking if the data exists does not suffice for data inconsistencies, and ensuring that the data is in the expected form (ie. a single or list of house numbers) and actually exists, needs to be done before proper analysis can be performed, as was exemplified in the above report."
